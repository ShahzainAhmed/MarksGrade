## Python Program to Take in the Marks of 5 Subjects and Display the Grade:

### Problem Solution: 
- Take in the marks of 5 subjects from the user and store it in different variables.
- Find the average of the marks.
- Use an else condition to decide the grade based on the average of the marks.

### Program Explanation: 
- User must enter 5 different values and store it in separate variables.
- Then sum up all the five marks and divide by 5 to find the average of the marks.
- If the average is greater than 90, “Grade: A” is printed.
- If the average is in between 80 and 90, “Grade: B” is printed.
- If the average is in between 70 and 80, “Grade: C” is printed.
- If the average is in between 60 and 70, “Grade: D” is printed.
- If the average is anything below 60, “Grade: F” is printed.
